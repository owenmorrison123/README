# Binary Addition
Binary addition is Less numbers but more thinking. Since we aren't used to adding with 2 digits, this can be confusing. Once you get the hang of it then it is pretty simple.
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 1 = 1 0 (carry the one to the next line)
In Binary there are only 2 digits so there are no hundreds, tens, thousandths. You say the numbers you have, so 1 0 would read one zero, opposed to in the numbers we know it would read ten.
