# Binary Addition
Binary addition is Less numbers but more thinking. Since we aren't used to adding with 2 digits, this can be confusing. Once you get the hang of it then it is pretty simple.
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 1 = 1 0 (carry the one to the next line)
In Binary there are only 2 digits so there are no hundreds, tens, thousandths. You say the numbers you have, so 1 0 would read one zero, opposed to in the numbers we know it would read ten. 
# Half Adder
A half adder is a circuit that takes two inputs, A and B, and turns them into outputs, S (sum of A and B) and C (carry out). It uses am XOR gate and an AND gate to perform the addition

This is how the adding would work for binary. As you can see they carry the one because 1 + 1 = 1 0

As you can see the two inputs make two outputs. The adding works the same as a truth table. This is a way that you could help yourself with the adding if you struggle but understand the concept of truth tables.

This is what it would look like with binary addition of 1 + 1

This is what it would look like if you added the binary 0 + 1

This is a motherboard of a computer and as you can tell they are very intricate. They have half adders in them.
